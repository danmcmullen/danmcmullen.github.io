The Team Staff guide and tutorial video linked below should be shared with every team. The video is very thorough and shows exactly what needs to be done.

In areas where cell service is poor or not available, teams will need to be made aware this will be an issue at the rink itself. They will need to prepare the time sign offs in advance of arriving to the arena for both home and away teams.

If there is not cell service or wifi in an arena the games can be scored on a paper game sheet and entered later where there’s Wi-Fi service or from anywhere there’s cell service after the fact.

Association/Zones will need to have a process set up to do this. I recommended having someone on their executive trained and available to input the game details.

I would prefer this to be someone other than coaches or managers to prevent changes or additions to what has been recorded on the game sheet.

For example:

- someone assisted on a goal and didn’t get credit or  
- someone actually scored a goal and didn’t get credit  
- if it is on the game sheet that is how it has to be recorded
